This is for a class assignment, pay no attention to this unless you are the one who is giving me a grade.

Here are a list of things about me:
-
* This is the last semester of classes
* I used Mardown a few years ago in attempting to learn about LBRY
    * LBRY was a videohosting service on blockchain, I do not use it anymore
* I have taught myself how to use Dacvinci Resolve for video editing
    * I have created over 2000 videos as an excuse to ignore the pandemic
* I run a featured collection on the Internet Archive
    * [Game and Video Game Confrences](https://archive.org/details/gameconferences)

Part 2: Awesome Dataset: [Getty Vocabularies](http://vocab.getty.edu/)

The reason I mention this is that as someone who is not familiar with SPARQL the ability to see some queries it is nice to have a starting point.  The controlled vocabulary is something that I realize I need to create for my own project and finding other ones outside of LCSH is a nice comparision in finding the dos and donts in creating this.  While there is an online box to enter in some queries, it is encouraged to use an application that is fmailiar with SPARQL and point it to the dataset to get the full potential.
