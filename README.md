This is for a class assignment, pay no attention to this unless you are the one who is giving me a grade.

Here are a list of things about me:
-
* This is the last semester of classes
* I used Mardown a few years ago in attempting to learn about LBRY
    * LBRY was a videohosting service on blockchain, I do not use it anymore
* I have taught myself how to use Dacvinci Resolve for video editing
    * I have created over 2000 videos as an excuse to ignore the pandemic
* I run a featured collection on the Internet Archive
    * [Game and Video Game Confrences]('https://archive.org/details/gameconferences')
